django-find-view
================

A small utility that finds the view function for a given named URL. The main
purpose of this is as a helper that can be called from an IDE/editor to provide
“jump to definition” from things like ``{% url %}`` tags.

Install into your venv::

  pip install django-find-view

Or with uv::

  uv add --dev django-find-view


See ``django-find-view --help`` for usage instructions.
